# BUSINESS-BIG-DATA-ANALYTICS-CAPSTONE

---
### Description
This is a course that my university and a well-known automaker collaborated on. The goal of the course is to create a project that provides commercial value to the partner company. Our team received Vehicle-to-everything data, which also includes car GPS data. Therefore, we used this data to extract the types of businesses near the places where the car owners stopped, and organized them into another dataset.
Next, we used the LSTM Auto Encoder technique to encode the new dataset. Finally, we used the K-means++ and Affinity Propagation clustering models to find cars with similar features.
